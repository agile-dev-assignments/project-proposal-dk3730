## Stock Strategy Analyzer

###### I'm sure I'll find a better name

### What and why?

    - I would like to build a web app that, in essence, considers a stock's historical price chart and
    compares the returns of various traditional trading strategies. This is not intended to attempt to
    predict future returns. It is simply a tool to analyze the past.
    - Solves the problem of "What if I had done this...?"
    - This information could be useful, as users that hold certain positions could see the effectiveness
    of past strategies.

### For whom?

    - For retail investors

### How?

    - Show the user historical pricing.
    - Show users various traditional trading strategies.
    - Apply these strategies to the price and show returns over some interval of time.
    - Potentially some other small features (maybe like an options price calculator based on some params).

### Scope

    - I cannot be entirely sure if this project is too ambitious, but I am sure that there are APIs that have
    this data available. I am aware that QuantConnect might have some useful resources. I do not think a
    preliminary draft is too big for even 1 developer to do given a few months.
